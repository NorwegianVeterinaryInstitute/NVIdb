\title{NVIdb: A package to facilitate the use of the Norwegian Veterinary Institute's databases.}
\description{
The NVIdb package provides functions to facilitate downloading and processing of data from NVI's databases, in particular PJS and EOS.
    The package comprises four categories of functions:
    manage credentials, login, read and copy data from in-house data registers and translation of codes into descriptive text.
}
\section{Manage credentials}{

Set and remove credentials (i.e. password and user name) in the user profile at the current machine. These functions makes it possible
to connect to database services automatically in scripts while avoiding hard coding of the password and the user name.
}

\section{Login}{

These functions use the credentials set by functions for managing credentials to automatically login to database services.
If the credentials have not been set, there are also login function for interactive input of credentials in windows when running scripts.
}

\section{Read, copy and update R-data from in-house data registers}{

The NVI has copies of several data registers like kommuneregister, fylkesregister, register for søknad om Produksjonstilskudd.
The aim of these functions are to make these registers easily accessible for R-scripts to ensure that one always uses the latest version
of data. These functions reads the registers from where they are saved at NVI internal file system. If necessary, there are function to
copy or update the registers to local directories when local versions are needed for example for shiny applications.
}

\section{Translate codes into descriptive text}{

Data often only includes codes that should be translated into the description text. These functions perform the translation for
PJS-codes and codes like komnr.
