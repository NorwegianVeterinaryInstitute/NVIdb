For database services where one don't use the premade wrappers, the name

base.}

another name than the dbservice in the windows asking for username and
password.}

\description{
Log in to NVI's data base services, in particular journal_rapp/PJS and EOS.
}
\details{
The NVI has access to several database services. These functions log
    in to such services. The functions provides methods to either log in using
    credentials set in the user profile by \code{\link{set_credentials}} or use
    input windows for username and password. Thereby the hard coding of
    username and password can be avoided.

    \code{login} is general functions where all necessary specifications like
    server name and database name of the database must be input. The database
    provider can give information on what specifications that has to be used.
    This can be used to log in to many different databases. In the case that
    one login to a database service for which the connection parameters have
    been predefined (i.e. PJS, EOS, sea_sites and Fallvilt), it will be sufficient
    to provide the parameter \code{dbservice =}.

    Depending on whether username and password have been saved in the users
    profile at the current computer or not, the user is asked to input credentials.

    \code{login_by_input} is general functions where all necessary
    specifications like server name and database name of the database must be
    input. In the case that one login to a database service for which the
    connection parameters have been predefined (i.e. PJS, EOS, sea_sites and
    Fallvilt), it will be sufficient to provide the parameter \code{dbservice =}.
    The user is always asked to input username and password.

    \code{login_by_credentials} is general functions where all necessary
    specifications like server name and database name of the database must be
    input. In the case that one login to a database service for which the
    connection parameters have been predefined (i.e. PJS, EOS, sea_sites and
    Fallvilt), it will be sufficient to provide the parameter \code{dbservice =}.
    The user is never asked for username and password, and the function can
    only be used when the credentials previously have been set in the user's
    profile at the current computer.

    \code{login_PJS}, \code{login_by_input_PJS}, and \code{login_by_credentials_PJS}
    are wrappers for the functions above where the specifications for the
    database journal_rapp/PJS have been preset. The user only need to input
    username and password. In the case that the username and password for
    journal_rapp/PJS have been stored in the user profile at the current
    computer, the user is automatically logged in to journal_rapp. If the
    password is no longer valid, an error occur. If so, the user must update
    the username and password by \code{\link{set_credentials_PJS}}.

    \code{login_EOS}, \code{login_by_input_EOS}, and \code{login_by_credentials_EOS}
    are wrappers for the functions above where the specifications for the
    database EOS have been preset. The user only need to input username and
    password or if the credentials are saved in the users profile by
    \code{\link{set_credentials_EOS}}, no input is needed.

    The login functions returns an open ODBC-channel to the database service.
    The database can then be queried by using functions in the package used for
    data base interface. The data base interface must be one of \code{odbc},
    \code{RODBC} or, \code{RPostgreSQL}. The default is given in NVIconfig and is
    \code{RODBC} for "SQL server" and \code{RPostgreSQL} for "PostgreSQL".

    When the session is finished, the script shall close the ODBC-channel by
    \code{odbcClose("myodbcchannel")} or \code{odbcCloseAll}.
