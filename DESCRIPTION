Description: The Norwegian Veterinary Institute has several internal databases as well as 
    access to data from external databases. This package provides functions to facilitate 
    downloading and processing of data from such databases, in particular PJS and EOS. The 
    package comprises four categories of functions: 
    1) Manage credentials (i.e. password and username), 
    2) Login functions for database services, 
    3) Read, copy and update different in-house data registers, 
    4) Translate codes into descriptions. 
    NVIdb is dependant of NVIconfig which has to be installed manually from GitHub.
