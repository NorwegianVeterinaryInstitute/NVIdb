    the Norwegian Veterinary Institute's databases, in particular PJS and EOS. The 
    package comprises several categories of functions: 
    1) Manage credentials (i.e. password and username), 
    2) Login functions for database services, 
    3) Select PJS-data, 
    4) Initial cleaning of PJS-data,
    5) Read, copy and update various in-house data registers, 
    6) Translate codes into descriptions. 
    NVIdb is dependant of NVIconfig which has to be installed manually from GitHub.
