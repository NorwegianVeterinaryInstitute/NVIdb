Description: Provides tools to facilitate downloading and processing of data from 
    the Norwegian Veterinary Institute's databases. The package comprises several 
    categories of functions.

    2) Login functions for database services, 
    3) Read, copy and update various in-house data registers, 
    4) Translate codes into descriptions. 
    NVIdb is dependant of NVIconfig which has to be installed manually from GitHub.
